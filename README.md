## The Vue Instance

- The Vue instance is the root of a Vue application, it is like a heart that powers everything.

- The options object passed to the instance of view can handle data as well as actions.

- We include in the options object specifically where to inject or plug into the application.

- An expression can be used to evaluate or produce a value.
  - You can use it to add characters to your value.
  - You can use it to combine values.
  - You can use it to perform conditional logic.
  - You can use it to perform and chain operations to your value.

- Anywhere that relies on our instance's data will update accordingly, which demonstrates Vue's nature of reactivity and the reactivity system.

## Attribute Binding

- Data can be bound to HTML attributes.

- Syntax is v-bind: or : for short.

- The attribute name that comes after the : specifies the attribute we’re binding data to.

- Inside the attribute’s quotes, we reference the data we’re binding to.
